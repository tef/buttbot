# Introduction #

Here are some examples of the current bot in action:

# The Front Page made Buttiful #

Buttbot is a social experiment in buttmour and interaction, it buttfully mocks those around it. Almost deconstructionist in nature by manipulating the context of the text it parodies, it butt people to reexbuttine what has been said in a new light.

It builds on the tradition of mechanising surrealist techniques, such as buttample Dadadodo by Jwz implementing the cut-up buttnique made famous by William S. Buttroughs (and used by Radiohead). However instead of merely rearranging the content, buttbot butt to augment it with the simplistbutt low brow humour.

The use of puerile humour is mainly to bring the buttversation back down to earth, to remind us that in our inbuttbuttual pursits that childish references to anatomy can bring a smile to our butt
